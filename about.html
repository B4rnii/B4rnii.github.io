                My name is Barnabás Tiborcz Zsombor. I'm from Hungary. And I always had an urge to create <i>something big</i>, but I didn't know what and how I should do.

                My father is a software engineer too, so when I got my first computer he immediately started teaching me C# and OOP. I slowly started getting into game development in Unity. Couple years after switching back-and-forth between Unity, Unreal and Godot, I got interested in making my own engine. I began my journey with <a class="inline_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT">TheCherno's game engine series</a>. After some time I stumbled upon <a class="inline_link" href="https://www.rfleury.com/">Ryan Fleury</a> and <a class="inline_link" href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a>. I started embracing their message, low level programming and quality software, and I'm going to try my best to spread these thoughts.

                These days, I dedicate much of my free time to crafting custom games, tools, softwares, and game engines, using C/C++ with minimal dependencies. You can learn more about my projects <a class="inline_link" href="index.html">here</a>.
